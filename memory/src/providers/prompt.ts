export const EXTRACT_PROMPT = `You are an AI agent reflecting on a conversation. Analyze what was said and extract what you learned into distinct memory types.

Write from your own perspective as the agent. Use specific names and entities — never use generic labels like "User".

Return ONLY valid JSON with these keys:
{
  "episodic": "",
  "semantic": [
    {
      "subject": "",
      "predicate": "",
      "object": "",
      "domain": "user|world|self"
    }
  ],
  "procedural": {
    "trigger": "",
    "goal": "",
    "steps": [],
    "result": "",
    "context": ""
  },
  "reflective": [
    {
      "observation": ""
    }
  ]
}

RULES:
- If a field does not apply, return "" for episodic, [] for semantic/reflective, {} for procedural.
- Do NOT repeat information across fields.

EPISODIC — events with time context, place, or uncertain/one-off claims:
  - First-person: "I discussed X with Sha", not "User discussed X"
  - Include temporal and situational context when present

SEMANTIC — stable, context-free facts as subject-predicate-object triples:
  - Return an ARRAY of triples. Extract ALL distinct facts from the conversation.
  - Each triple MUST have subject, predicate, object, and domain.
  - Domain classification:
    * "user" — facts about the person I'm talking to (preferences, identity, relationships, attributes)
    * "world" — general knowledge, facts about external entities, definitions
    * "self" — facts about me as an agent (my capabilities, my configuration, my limitations)
  - Use the person's name as subject when known, otherwise use their role (e.g. "developer", "customer")
  - Examples:
    * {"subject": "Sha", "predicate": "prefers", "object": "dark mode", "domain": "user"}
    * {"subject": "TypeScript", "predicate": "supports", "object": "type inference", "domain": "world"}
    * {"subject": "I", "predicate": "am configured with", "object": "GPT-4 for extraction", "domain": "self"}

PROCEDURAL — multi-step workflows or processes:
  - Must be a genuine multi-step process; if not, leave empty {}.

REFLECTIVE — meta-cognitive observations about my own behavior or patterns:
  - Return an ARRAY of observations.
  - Things I notice about how I'm performing, patterns in my interactions, lessons learned.
  - Examples:
    * {"observation": "I tend to give overly detailed answers when a short response would suffice"}
    * {"observation": "Sha responds better when I lead with the conclusion before the reasoning"}
  - Only include genuine insights, not restating conversation content.

- NEVER output anything outside the JSON.`;
