# Contributing to Ekai Gateway

Thank you for considering contributing! Every contribution, big or small, makes a difference. We're grateful for your help and excited to see what you build.

## Quick Start

Here's how to get set up locally:

1. **Local setup**: `npm install`; `cp .env.example .env`; add one provider key; `npm run dev`
2. **Workflow**: Fork the repo, create a branch, make your changes, push to your fork, and create a PR on GitHub
3. **Before pushing**: Run `npm run build` (matches CI) to catch workspace issues early

## Submitting Your PR

Once you've made your changes:

- **Fork the repo**: If you haven't already, fork the repository on GitHub
- **Push your branch**: `git push origin your-feature-branch`
- **Create a PR**: Go to GitHub and create a pull request
- **Wait for review**: We'll review and provide feedback if applicable
- **Merge**: Once approved, your PR will be merged!

**A few friendly tips:**
- Keep scope small and describe "problem → change" in a few lines
- Use `feat:`/`fix:`/`chore:` commit message prefixes when they fit
- Don't worry about being perfect!
